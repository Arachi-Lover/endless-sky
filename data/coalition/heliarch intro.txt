One or two warehouses have a fair bit of rust on their doors, and just once did you spot one with a damaged roof. You can also make out the shapes of small trees and bushes not too far out.`

			`	At first glance there is nothing inside, but after he furiously crawls all over the place, he puts his head to a large metal panel on the opposite end of the room, before shooting that too, revealing a hidden staircase leading underground.`
			`	On your way down, Kirrie yells for you to take cover, and you barely escape a barrage of shots. Kirrie is hit on one of his legs before he can take cover.`

A pair of Heliarch Punishers land nearby shortly after, and dozens of armed agents enter the warehouse, while you wait with Kirrie as his wound is treated.`

			`Kirrie, already donning his winter coat, instructs you to land near the equator. He and Tugroob will conduct some subtle interrogation, citing that it's 'all they can do' in this climate.`
			`	You drop them off in one of the larger settlements there. After they leave, Iplora asks that you bring her to what is very close to a polar region.`
			`	"Suspiciously similar, independent reports on that area have been. Tasked with investigating it, I was."`
			`	As you land on an isolated icy patch in the middle of a snowstorm, she's ready to leave the ship, carrying a bag with some equipment and wearing what is - compared to what her colleagues were wearing - fairly light clothing. Although she is a Saryd, you still worry that she might be frostbitten in this extreme weather, but she reassures you that she will be fine.`

			`	You slouch around your ship for a few hours, waiting for any signal from the Heliarch agents, but nothing comes up on your commlink. Iplora comes back, saying she couldn't find anything, so you leave and pick up Kirrie and Tugroob, who also return empty handed.`
				accept
			label snow
			`	She remains silent, and walks back inside. You close the hatch and prepare yourself for what's to come with the warmest clothing you could find. You open the hatch once more, and the both of you head out into the white fields. Not long after leaving your ship, you can make out small, dark lines nearby, probably pine trees. It seems you landed close to a forest. Unfortunately, they don't do much to protect you from the snowfall.`
			`	You continue deeper into the lifeless forest for what feels like hours, so long that your feet start feeling numb from the cold. After yet another turn, Iplora guides you out of the forest to snowy hills. The storm is not so terrible here, so you can faintly see cave entrances in some of the more distant hills. Looking back at the woods, you see that there's a small shack in the outskirts, not too far from where you are now.`
			`	"Check the caverns, we must. More relentless, the storm will soon become," Iplora says.`
			choice
				`	"Lead the way."`
					goto bumpyroad
				`	"You go ahead. I'll see if I can find anything in that shack."`
			`	She nods, and starts making her way uphill. You start walking to the shack, but just a couple steps into it you trip on something hard, unlike the soft, deep snow you've been in up until now.`
			`	Iplora notices it and walks over to you, "Many boulders, this area has. Buried by the snow they have been. Great care you must take, while walking here," she explains before getting on with her own path to the caverns.`
			`	You reach the shack, and knock to see if anyone is inside, but even your soft hits were enough to push the door open. The place is abandoned, with a few boxes laying around, small bedrooms, and what must be a Kimek-styled fireplace. A large carpet covers the center of the living room.`
			`	You pull it up but find nothing hidden underneath. You leave the shack, circling it, finding only a few tools on the ground, by the back. You take another look around, and even start checking some of the nearby trees, but as the snowfall grows stronger, you decide to head to the caverns and catch up with Iplora.`
			`	You trip over a few more of the small mounds, and right in the middle of the snowfield, you start wondering which cavern Iplora is in now. Though you can't be sure if you'll find her by entering the nearest one, it would certainly be better than standing outside in what will soon be a blizzard.`
			choice

					goto shelter
				`	(Try and dig through the snowy mounds to find something.)`
			label dig
			`	You claw away at the snow and hit a hard surface, but it turns out to be just a rock. You try some other mounds to no avail, and right as you finish digging through another pile of snow only to find another rock, Iplora appears behind you.`
			`	"Counterproductive, cleaning away the snow is," she says. "Found nothing, I have. Back to your ship, we must go."`
			choice
				`	(Go back to the ship.)`
					goto back
				`	(Keep digging.)`
					goto keepdig
			label shelter
			`	You rush inside the nearest cave, waiting for the weather to clear up a bit. After a while you notice a light coming from further inside the cave, and Iplora emerges soon after. "Found anything?" She asks, and you shake your head. Aside from some small campsites, she didn't either. You wait inside a bit more, and when the weather clears and night approaches, you follow her back to the ship.`
			`	Once you're there, you leave to pick up Kirrie and Tugroob, who also come back empty handed.`
				accept
			label bumpyroad
			`	Following her up the hills proves difficult at first, with your legs sinking into the snow, but after a few minutes the ground below becomes more and more solid - if a bit bumpy. Iplora explains that the area has several small and medium sized boulders buried by the snow over the years. You try to watch your step, but as the snowfall grows stronger, you trip over one of the mounds. She helps you up, and the two of you eventually arrive at the entrance of one of the caverns.`
			choice
				`	(Go inside with Iplora.)`
					goto cave
				`	(Search around the snow field.)`
			`	You tell her you'll look around the snow for a while and go inside if the storm gets rough again. Walking around the snow, this time minding the bumpy ground below, you try to spot anything unusual in the snow. Although the scenery is a great sight, the task itself quickly becomes dull, and even after walking far away from the hills, shows no results. The snow starts falling much faster, so you begin making your way back to the caverns.`
			`	With all the snow blocking your vision, you end up tripping over some of the mounds on your way and realize you don't exactly remember which cave Iplora entered. Considering the weather, though, taking shelter in any of them would be a good choice.`

					goto shelter

			`	Iplora brings out a flashlight and lights up the way as you two explore the caverns. After some twists and turns, she notices some large rocks, broken free from the walls, but still hugging them closely. She asks that you hold the flashlight for her, and starts pushing the rocks, revealing a passage to a small campsite, with some makeshift beds, small wooden crates, and a worn down campfire in the middle.`
			`	You search through the crates as she examines the room looking for some other hidden area, but neither of you find anything. She checks the campfire and concludes that nobody has been here for a few months. You continue exploring the cave and eventually loop back outside, leaving via another cave entrance, this time much further from the forest according to Iplora. You can't even see the trees anymore, the blizzard has gotten much stronger.`
			choice
				`	(Suggest returning to the ship.)`
					goto bumpyblizzard
				`	(Continue looking around the caves.)`
			`	You head back inside and continue exploring the cave system. You two find a few more of the hidden campsites, but all are as abandoned as the first one. You're alerted by the wind, snow, and ice whenever you're close to another exit.`
			`	After a few hours, the storm finally subsides, and you both return to your ship. you leave to pick up Kirrie and Tugroob, who also come back empty handed.`
				accept
			label bumpyblizzard
			`	Iplora hesitates for a bit, then explains that you would probably get sick going through the storm now. She suggests you wait in the cave until it is safe for human passage.`
			`	You insist, and she reluctantly gives in, telling you to stick close to her. She moves slowly, so you have no problem keeping up, but time and again you keep falling over, tripping on the mounds the rocks have created. Another fall, and Iplora reaches her hand out to help you up once again.`
			choice
				`	(Take her hand.)`
				`	(Try and dig through the snow to find something.)`
					goto snowdig
			label back
			`	She helps you up, and you continue on your way down the hills. You get back to the forest, and she starts finding the trail back to the ship. Halfway through, the storm gets progressively weaker.`

				accept
			label snowdig
			`	You start clawing your way down the snow as Iplora asks you to stop and continue moving toward the ship You continue, your hands getting colder as the snow steals the heat even through your gloves. You hit a hard surface and start clearing from there, only to see it was, in fact, just a boulder.`
			`	"Satisfied? Return, we must. Come now," You turn to see her offering her hand once again.`
			choice
				`	(Take her hand.)`
					goto back
				`	(Head to another mound and try digging there.)`
			label keepdig
			`	You stand up and run to another spot where you fell over. Iplora follows you, and even with the snow you can hear her exasperated sigh. She tries to pull you away, but you hit a hard surface yet again, and a faint metallic sound echoes. She takes her hands off of you and lays down, now helping you dig out whatever is there. She stands up once the crate is visible. It's large and looks like a coffin, but much of it is still buried. She asks you to help her get some hooks on it, after which she struggles to try and pull it out.`
			`	The slippery snow certainly doesn't help her hooves, but it does make the crate slippery as well. It's coaxed out of the ground, bit by bit. You help her as best as you can and eventually get it on top of the snow field. Iplora searches through some tools in her bag and takes out what looks like a crowbar. She starts opening it, a dim light creeping out, but an energy blast, coming from the the top of the hills, hits the ground near the hole, missing you by just about a meter.`
			`	She yells for you to get down, pulling out her weapon and firing in the direction the shot came from.`

					goto help
			`	You get inside the hole, hoping you'll have enough protection from the blasts, and hear Iplora move around, occasionally peeking to see her shooting and taking cover, running and dodging incoming blasts. The shots stop, and you see her come over, saying you can get out now.`
			`	"Fled, our attacker has," she claims. From the looks of it she wasn't injured. You two get back to the crate.`
				goto opencrate
			label help
			`	You start shooting the hills above, trying to aim around where Iplora's own shots go to. A shot comes your way, and you jump to the side. Iplora takes cover inside the hole, firing a few more shots from there, then leaves, going uphill. You follow her lead, approaching from another direction.`
			`	The shots alternate targets, some heading to Iplora, then some to you, then back at her. The blizzard is bad enough that you can't even see the attacker, but it seems that goes both ways, as you and Iplora manage to avoid getting hit without too much trouble.`
			`	You've barely gotten past the last cave you visited when the shots stop altogether. Iplora still takes aim for a bit, but ultimately lowers her weapon, coming toward you. "Fled, our attacker has," she claims. You two walk back to the crate.`
			label opencrate
			`	When it's finally open, you see it contains a Heliarch finisher torpedo. You two go around the fields, and find that many other mounds are identical crates. She uses a communication device and calls for Heliarch support. Several Heliarch Neutralizers arrive some time after the blizzard subsides, and you're directed to one of them to dry your clothes and make sure you're not frostbitten.`
			`	Once you leave, you see several Heliarch agents using proper equipment to dig out the crates and opening them dozens at a time, revealing several more torpedoes. A group has also made their way up the hills looking for any sign of whoever attacked you. Iplora speaks with some of the Heliarchs there, then tells you that they will handle everything from here. One of the ships takes you two to where your own ship landed and leaves as you prepare to take off.`
			`	You head back to pick up Kirrie and Tugroob, who are excited to hear about what happened. They themselves didn't find anything, but they're content with listening to Iplora as she tells the story.`

			`	Some ten minutes pass before anyone comes in, but after that many Heliarch members start filling up the room, taking their own seats at the table. When the door opens for the last of them to come in, the guard announces "Consul Aulori," to which all the Helliarchs stand up and salute, the noise of conversation giving room to hooves hitting the ground. An old Saryd of gray eyes, pale hairs, with a short, well-kept beard, wearing a peculiar necklace with four large gemstones hanging from it. He sits opposite to you, the other Heliarchs sitting back down when he does.`
			`	"Forgive me for the delay you must, colleagues," he says to the other Heliarchs. "Caught up in my evening prayers, I was." He examines the room for a while, briefly glancing at each of the Heliarchs, until his eyes settle on yours. "Told, I was, that some valuable information for us, you have, Captain <last>."`

				`	"I know of a system where a broken Quarg ringworld is. I figured I should tell you."`
				`	"Would I be paid if I told you about a place where you can find a broken Quarg ringworld?"`

			`	He asks again, and you repeat it again. "An... incomplete ringworld, is it?"`
			choice
				`	"I didn't say incomplete, I said broken. I know the difference."`
				`	"Is this some joke? If you don't care about the broken ringworld, just tell me. Don't waste my time."`
			`	He leans forward lightly, staring at you. Looking around the table, the other Heliarchs are engaged in a what appears to be a quiet, heated discussion, gesticulating and occasionally tilting the table with their body weight amidst whispers.`
			`	"How?" Aulori asks, eyes still locked on you. You explain as best as you can about where Deneb is, and what you saw on the other side of the wormhole. When you get to explaining how the system was discovered, the Heliarchs seem to collectively gasp when you first utter the word "Pug." You pause, and many go back to the quiet, whispering discussions, some laughing it off, and others staying silent.`
			`	One Saryd moves as if getting up, but sits back down once Aulori stands up, firmly pushing one hand against the table. Conversation around the table dies out, as he stares you down for a long minute. "Leave us for a moment, would you?" He finally says, having some guards bring you outside the room.`
			`	The whispering discussion from earlier now becomes a much louder debate, though the door muffles it all enough that no translator outside the room manages to pick up what is being said. After half an hour, most voices are cut as someone rapidly hits the table, roughly, yelling something in what you think is the Saryd language.`
			`	It all grows quiet for a while, and then the door opens again. Some of the other Heliarchs leave in a haste, and you're asked to head inside again. Consul Aulori is standing up still, giving you a nod as you come in.`
			`	"Adjusted, your ship's sensors will be. Better suited, they will become, for detailed tridimensional projections," he says. He has a guard bring you back to your ship, where some engineers go inside your ship and spend some time tinkering with it. After they're done, one of the Heliarchs that was in the room approaches you, telling you they need you to land on the planet you described, <stopovers>, and to travel to <waypoints> to scan the ringworld.

			`	"Skeptical of what you told us, we all were, Captain," Aulori says, gesturing for you to accompany him as he walks around the projection. "Claimed that insane, you were, some of those here did," he reaches down to tap a Kimek on her head, "Or that wasting our time with jokes, you were," he bumps another Saryd's arm, "Assured me, some of them had, that wholly impossible, it was, to break a ring," he pushes an Arach's leg with his hoof. He stops where the projection shows signs of greater damage, where a large chunk of the ring was cut off, littered with floating debris. "But not insane, neither a joker, you are. And impossible, this clearly is not. Invaluable information, what you've brought us is, Captain <last>. Investigate the site thoroughly, we must, so ask for your assistance again, we will, when a suitable crew for it, we have found."`

			`	"And wait around for years, we will not," Aulori interrupts him again. "Either find someone willing, or find another line of work, you will," he looks at the Saryd, then at the door.`

			`	When it's all over, you're escorted back to your ship, where you're told that the circlet serves as a permission to buy certain outfits. They also hand you a small box, a translation device. "One of us you now are, Captain," the Saryd says. "Find some new work in our job boards, you may, if properly equipped, you are."`
			`	The trio congratulates you once again, and wish you safe travels.`
